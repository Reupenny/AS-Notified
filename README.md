# Better-Notified

A Wordpress plugin to keep you notified of the important things.

Please note this is my first plugin for wordpress and i am new to PHP.

## To Do List

- add options in settings to disable and enable each notification type
- seperate out the single PHP file into different files such as a setting.php

Plugin Update Checker is being used to push updates and once the plugin is out of beta it will be published on Wordpress.
